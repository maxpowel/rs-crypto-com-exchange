# rs-crypto-com-exchange
This is an unofficial websocket library for the crypto com exchange websocket api https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/spot/index.html#websocket-root-endpoints
Library doc is available at https://docs.rs/crypto-com-exchange/latest/crypto_com_exchange/

Check the [examples](examples) and tests to see how does it work until I provide more documentation.

This library is meant to be a simple and low level as possible so you
can build your own application on top of this in the way you are
more comfortable.

If you have any suggestion or idea, I would be glad to hear them!
